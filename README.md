# ThermoD-of-a-Rubber-band-Heat-engine
Academic Supervisor: Prof. Vikram Vyas.

In the following, we study the thermodynamics of a rubber band and calculate the efficiency of Archibaldâ€™s rubber band heat engine. The efficiency of this rubber band engine is then compared with the efficiency of a Carnot rubber band engine.
